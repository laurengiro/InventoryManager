## Overview
Inventory manager is an application which manages an inventory of products. The application will enable the user 
to view the products they have in their inventory, add new products to their inventory, mark items as discontinued, calculate their 
inventory value, track and view their sales history, and generate a demand forecast.

- Add Sales To An Inventory Item: Users will be able to add sales from the previous month(s) to an inventory item.
